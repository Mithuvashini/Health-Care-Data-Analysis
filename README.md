# Health Care Dashboard – AI Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes **healthcare, lifestyle, and medical cost data** to identify relationships between smoking, cancer history, diabetes status, age, weight category, surgery frequency, and hospital charges.  
The dashboard is designed to support **data-driven healthcare insights**, cost analysis, and risk pattern identification.

## Key Objectives
- Compare cancer history between smokers and non-smokers
- Analyze diabetes status against average age
- Study the relationship between surgeries and patient age
- Evaluate medical charges by weight category
- Compare hospital tier-wise charges
- Understand customer distribution across city tiers

## Dashboard Visualizations
- **Cancer History vs Smoker & Non-Smoker**
  - Highlights higher cancer incidence among smokers
- **Diabetes Status vs Average Age**
  - Shows age progression from normal → prediabetes → diabetes
- **Surgery Count vs Average Age**
  - Indicates higher surgery frequency in older age groups
- **Weight Status vs Medical Charges**
  - Obesity contributes the largest share of healthcare costs
- **Hospital Tier vs Charges**
  - Tier-2 hospitals account for the highest total charges
- **City Tier vs Customer Count**
  - Tier-2 cities show the highest patient volume

## Filters & Slicers
- Cancer History (Yes / No)
- Smoker (Yes / No)
- Weight Status (Underweight, Normalweight, Overweight, Obesity)
- Diabetes Status (Normal, Prediabetes, Diabetes)
- Number of Surgeries

## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI**
- **DAX** for calculated measures
- **Excel / CSV** healthcare dataset

## Key Insights
- Smokers show **significantly higher cancer incidence** than non-smokers
- Average age increases sharply for **diabetic patients**
- Patients undergoing more surgeries tend to be **older**
- **Obesity accounts for the majority of medical charges**, far outweighing other weight categories
- **Tier-2 hospitals** generate the highest overall charges
- Patient concentration is highest in **Tier-2 cities**, indicating urban healthcare pressure

## Use Case
This dashboard is useful for:
- Healthcare data analysts
- Insurance and claims analysis teams
- Hospital management and planning
- Preventive healthcare and risk assessment studies

## Notes
- Data is used for analytical and demonstration purposes only.
- Dashboard focuses on **pattern discovery and comparative analysis**, not clinical diagnosis.
